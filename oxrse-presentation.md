# Our challenges

- Visibility to researchers

- Convincing higher-ups RSE is important

- Prioritize RSE work over other duties

- Dedicated statistics support

- **Dedicated funding for RSE work**

# Future plans

- Get involved in grant applications 

- Standardize application for RSE services at UiT

- Exchange with other European RSE groups

- Employ people as dedicated RSEs (not HPC engineers)

- **Organize Nordic RSE conference 2026**
