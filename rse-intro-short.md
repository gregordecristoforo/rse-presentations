# Software development is part of research

- Scientists typically spend 30% of their time developing software

- 90% or more are primarily self-taught

- Many are unaware of tools and practices that would allow them to write more reliable and maintainable code with less effort

# Research software engineers

.. are people who combine .emph[professional software expertise] with an .emph[understanding of research] .cite[https://researchsoftware.org/]

- Often people **who grew up in research** and liked computing and programming

- ... or people **who come from software development** drawn towards meaningful and impactful work of academia

# Our vision

## Short term

- Provide consulting: good advice is **not** expensive
- .emph[Code review] sessions
- Work on "smaller" projects and .emph[document use cases]
- Focus on UiT
- Attract more projects 


## Longer term

- Be part of funding applications (successful applications with Hylleraas Centre and Framsenteret)
- Research groups have access to best in class RSE services
- Hire more staff who collaborate on projects
- "Proper" application procedure 
- Going beyond UiT
- .emph[Career path opportunities]
