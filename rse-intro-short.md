# Software development is part of research

- Scientists typically spend **30%** of their time developing software

- 90% or more are primarily self-taught

- Many are unaware of tools and practices that would allow them to write **more reliable and maintainable code** with less effort

# Research software engineers

- ... are people who combine .emph[professional software expertise] with an .emph[understanding of research] .cite[https://researchsoftware.org/]

- Often people **who grew up in research** and liked computing and programming

- ... or people **who come from software development** drawn towards meaningful and impactful work of academia
